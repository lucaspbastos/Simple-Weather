# IT 202 Simple Weather Web Application
This assignment for Spring 2020 IT 202, taught by Professor James McHugh, was to create a weather web application using the free [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), which is needed to run the project.

A user can input a ZIP code or use the geolocation option to automatically display weather information, with the option of displaying temperatures in Fahrenheit, Celsius, or Kelvin.

## Setup
The only setup required for this web application is to set the OpenWeather API key to an environment variable OPENWEATHER_API_KEY, for example: `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY={api key}`.
